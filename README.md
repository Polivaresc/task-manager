# TaskManager

This is a simple Task Manager application built with Angular. The main goal was to practice Angular concepts such as services, routing, and component-based architecture, while also exploring integration with third-party libraries like Chart.js for data visualization and Tailwind CSS for styling.

The app includes a basic login systemâ€”users must authenticate with a username and password to access task management features and charts. Authentication is handled via Angular services, and protected routes ensure that only logged-in users can interact with the core functionality.

The project emphasizes separation of concerns through modular design, including dedicated services for authentication and task management, reusable UI components, and a dashboard that visualizes task status using Chart.js.
